# QMatch
This is the code for the experiments in the ICCV publication 'QMatch: Iterative Shape Matching using Quantum annealing' in http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/QMATCH. 
You can run the code with D-Wave leap: https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap.
  One can either run code with the leap IDE or locally by installing ocean (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/getting_started.html). 
  To get to the Leap IDE one has to click on workspaces after logging in to Leap.
  In the Folder Qmatch/FaustDS there subsampled instances of the Faust dataset from http://faust.is.tue.mpg.de/. 
  In the Folder Qaplib/Qaplib there are the problem instances from https://www.opt.math.tugraz.at/qaplib/. Only some linebreaks have been added for the readout.
